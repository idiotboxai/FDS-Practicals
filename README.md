# FDS-Practicals Codes
FDS Practicals for sppu 2nd year students fds fundemental of data structure

## Group -A

1) In second year computer engineering class, group A student's play cricket, group B
students play badminton and group C students play football.
Write a Python program using functions to compute following: -
a) List of students who play both cricket and badminton
b) List of students who play either cricket or badminton but not both
c) Number of students who play neither cricket nor badminton
d) Number of students who play cricket and football but not badminton.
(Note- While realizing the group, duplicate entries should be avoided, Do not use SET
built-in functions)

2) Write a Python program to store marks scored in subject "Fundamental of Data
Structure" by N students in the class. Write functions to compute following:
a) The average score of class
b) Highest score and lowest score of class
c) Count of students who were absent for the test
d) Display mark with highest frequency

4) Write a Python program for department library which has N books, write functions for
following:
a) Delete the duplicate entries
b) Display books in ascending order based on cost of books
c) Count number of books with cost more than 500.
d) Copy books in a new list which has cost less than 500.

## Group-B

a)	Write a pythonprogram to store roll numbers of student in array who
attended training program in random order. Write function for searching
whether particular student attended training program or not,
using Linear search and Sentinel search. 

b) Write a python program to store roll numbers of student array who attended training
program in sorted order. Write function for searching whether particular student
attended training program or not, using Binary search and Fibonacci search.

c) Write a python program to store names and mobile numbers of your friends in sorted
order on names. Search your friend from list using binary search (recursive and nonrecursive).
Insert friend if not present in phonebook.

Q.2)
 
b) Write a python program to store names and mobile numbers of your friends in sorted
order on names. Search your friend from list using Fibonacci search. Insert friend if not
present in phonebook.

c) Write a Python program to store first year percentage of students in array. Write
function for sorting array of floating point numbers in ascending order using
1) Selection Sort
2) Bubble sort and display top five scores.

## Group-C

1) Department of Computer Engineering has student's club named 'Pinnacle Club'. Students
   of second, third and final year of department can be granted membership on request.
   Similarly one may cancel the membership of club. First node is reserved for president of
   club and last node is reserved for secretary of club. Write C++ program to maintain club
   member's information using singly linked list. Store student PRN and Name. Write
   functions to:
   a) Add and delete the members as well as president or even secretary.
   b) Compute total number of members of club
   c) Display members
   d) Two linked lists exists for two divisions. Concatenate two lists.

2) The ticket booking system of Cinemax theater has to be implemented using C++ program.
   There are 10 rows and 7 seats in each row. Doubly circular linked list has to be
   maintained to keep track of free seats at rows. Assume some random booking to start
   with. Use array to store pointers (Head pointer) to each row. On demand
   a) The list of available seats is to be displayed 
   b) The seats are to be booked
   c) The booking can be cancelled.

## Group-D 

1) A palindrome is a string of character that's the same forward and backward. Typically,
   punctuation, capitalization, and spaces are ignored. For example, "Poor Dan is in a droop"
   is a palindrome, as can be seen by examining the characters "poor danisina droop" and
   observing that they are the same forward and backward. One way to check for a
   palindrome is to reverse the characters in the string and then compare with them the
   original-in a palindrome, the sequence will be identical. Write C++ program with
   functions
   a) To print original string followed by reversed string using stack
   b) To check whether given string is palindrome or not

2) In any language program mostly syntax error occurs due to unbalancing delimiter such as
   (),{},[]. Write C++ program using stack to check whether given expression is well parenthesized or not.

## Group-E

1) Queues are frequently used in computer programming, and a typical example is the creation of a job queue by an operating system. 
   If the operating system does not use priorities, then the jobs are processed in the order they enter the system.
   Write C++ program for simulating job queue. Write functions to add job and delete job from queue.
2) A double-ended queue (deque) is a linear list in which additions and deletions may be made at either end. 
   Obtain a data representation mapping a deque into a onedimensional array. Write C++ program to simulate deque 
   with functions to add and delete elements from either end of the deque.
3) Pizza parlor accepting maximum M orders. Orders are served in first come first served
   basis. Order once placed cannot be cancelled. Write C++ program to simulate the system
   using circular queue using array.
